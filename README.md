# a-ghost-in-a-graveyard

An atmospheric side-scrolling game created with Lua and LÃ–VE, in which our Ghost collects skulls and spiders while avoiding tombstones, ponds of water, and nooses. 
The game gets progressively faster, and high scores are retained. All sprites, backgrounds, and features were designed and illustrated in Photoshop.
