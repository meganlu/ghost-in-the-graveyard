# A Ghost in a Graveyard

An atmospheric side-scrolling game created with Lua and LÃ–VE, in which our Ghost collects skulls and spiders while avoiding tombstones, ponds of water, and nooses. 

The game gets progressively faster and difficult with more obstacles being introduced, and high scores can be saved under multiple users. 

I designed and illustrated all sprites, backgrounds, and animations in Adobe Photoshop.
